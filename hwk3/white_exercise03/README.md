# Homework 3
This is the set of files necessary to execute Neighbor Joining on a FASTA file of sequences.

## Usage
To execute the file, run it on the command line with this format

$ python neisaitou.py inputfile.fna

Where *inputfile.fna* is the FASTA file that is to be processed.

## Outputs
There are 3 outputs from the *neisaitou.py* script.

1. The file *hw3_genetic_distance.txt* is the output of the distance matrix
    for each of the sequences in the FASTA file.

2. The file *hw3_edges.txt* is the list of edges in tab delimited text file format.

3. The file *hw3_newick_tree.txt* file is the NEWICK format for the phylogeny tree
    that was generated by the *neisaitou.py* code.

## Tree Graph
From the output text files, the tree graph is plotted using the supplied R scripts.

The following command will generate *tree.pdf*, which is the plot of the phylogeny tree.

$ rscript hw3-plot-newick.r hw3_newick_tree.txt hw3-tip-labels.txt

## Other Info
This code was run under Python 3.6 and R 3.5. A suite of tests wasn't generated and some bugs
may exist. If so, please contact the author for assistance.
